Changes from Acme behaviour and reason behind the difference:

CHANGE: word-by-word and line-by-line selection, backspace and del not extending an existing selection by one character
REASON: slightly more complex code makes yacco more aligned with the behaviour of modern text editor rather than Smalltalk 80. I also find many of those changes more ergonomic

CHANGE: configurability
REASON: people expect some amount of configurability, rather than reading a configuration file yacco collects all configuration options inside the "config" submodule to make patching easier.
No configuration file is read.

CHANGE: ctrl+left_click is equivalent to middle_click, alt+left_click is equivalent to right_click
REASON: an abundance of pointing devices curently available lacks a middle button (or has a scroll wheel that acts as one but is uncomfortable to use), some pointing devices don't even have a right button. Therefore a generic way to supplement them is needed

CHANGE: no chording
REASON: ergonomy studies of Bruce Tognazzini and Engelbar suggest that the fastest input method is a combination of mouse for pointing while inputting keyboard shortcuts with the other hand. Yacco supports this mode by providing (customizable) keybindings. As such no need for mouse chording is needed. The concept of mouse chording is also alien to most people.

CHANGE: removed commands: Font, Indent, Tab
REASON: All this commands have been replaced by external commands that use the extensions to the filesystem interface

CHANGE: removed command: Incl
REASON: No special code for the C language is implemented, rules for things similar to the Incl mechanism can be added to the plumb configuration

CHANGE: removed command: Local
REASON: The command is related to plan 9 namespaces that don't exist in unix. The new command Setenv to set environment variables is provided

CHANGE: the escape key does nothing, return in the tag selects everything past the | character and executes it
REASON: selecting through escape is unusual, anyway escape can be bound to anything the user might want through the shortcut configuration file. Return in the tag would otherwise be useless

CHANGE: In the edit language #w<number> selects word-by-word
REASON: It's useful

CHANGE: unlimited Undo and Redo
